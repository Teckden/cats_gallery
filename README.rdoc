== RUBY STACK TEST
We would like to create a private cats photo site with Ruby. Each user should be able to manage their own photos and assign titles and tags to them. Authenticated users can search all photos by title or tag, see thumbnails gallery for search results and be able to view full version of photo in a lightbox. Guests should not have access to the pictures. Help us to build this product!
